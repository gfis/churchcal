<a target="_top" href="/webapps/churchcal/"><strong>churchcal</strong></a>    generates a German common or (evangelic, catholic) church calendar 
    for any year from 1583 to 4099 after Christ's birth.  
    The program calculates Easter, Trinitatis and the other variable Sundays and holidays, 
    and outputs the calendar either as an HTML table, as XML, SQL INSERT statements 
    or in tab separated format. Headings for months and weekdays may be shown
    in German, English and several other languages.
